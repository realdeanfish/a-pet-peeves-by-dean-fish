# pet peeves by deanfish:
geez"people" are always fricking with me and
that's enough for that story. did you expect more?
you shouldn't. these nasty people are digging their holes
and expect me to fall into that. no thank you. puke more.
if you feel you should hear this, okay. real story:

once i went to the grocery store, i saw one of them and i asked
"hey, are you allowed to live in here?" which its illegal to do
and he said "dont deal with my problem, pal. you dont know me."
i said "tell me then." and he said "no." i got near to his face
and said "look, i know why you came here. like the others, you
wanted to live nicely. its not the issue. the issue is, you
are not allowed." and i nut to his head. he tried to escape
and i told my fella to close the door. what i did is not
important. you can believe this: he's deported.
the real thing is, he came here before he killed his wife.
the funny thing is, he had a daughter. if you are girl in hells bedroom,
rape is inevitable. and yeah, the woman tried to stop that and that grocery man
killed her with his baseball bat. it happened yesterday and it happens every time.

dont feel sorry. thats life.
have fun. i'll chug my beer.
